Our idea is to create a common platform, a kind of online judge
where admin/professor can host their contest in which they will set various problems of
various difficulty involving concepts of various data structures and algorithms.
On this platform students will attempt the contest simultaneously and will try different
approaches to solve the problems whose verdict will be shown after the submission, by
which professor will be able to check easily who is able to solve their problems and who
fail to do so.
To avoid plagiarism,in future plagiarism detectors will also be implemented to verify whether the
submission is plagiarized or not. The professor can also explain their approaches
regarding the various problems involving various concepts of different algorithms and
data structures by writing blogs on the platform which will also receive the feedback of
students and students will also have the freedom to exchange their thoughts between
themselves thereby resulting in the upliftment of overall coding culture of the institute.
